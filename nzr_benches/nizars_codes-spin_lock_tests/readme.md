the different code test multiple approaches for lucks

such as mutex lock, spin lock and atomic approaching to bypass locks all toghether

1.c is spin_lock

2.c is the mutex code

3.c is bypassing locks and using atomic operation

the goal of this code is to test application behaviour of using mutex (OS managed) and spin_lock which is  user space managed
